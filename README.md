# Crypto Stock Compare

This repository was created to help people learn the basic tasks that you need to perform when creating applications using [React](https://reactjs.org/). This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and you can find the most recent version of the user guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

The app uses real world data from the [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) financial API to compare the movement of Ethereum's value and Microsoft's stock price. This is all just a bit of fun and an attempt to have a real world example that is Not-Another-Todo-App(TM).

## Overview

The tutorial is split into multiple parts each covering a simple but important part of building a web app with React. You can find the finished code for each step in a branch with the corresponding name in brackets.

1. Creating a basic component (creating-basic-component)
1. Splitting a component into multiple components (splitting-components)
1. Using props to pass values and functions to sub-components (using-props)
1. Using state to manage fetching data from an API (using-state-for-api-requests)
1. Creating a new page with React Router (react-router)
1. Pulling state up to share data between components (pulling-state-up)

The intention of this repository and tutorial is to act as a guide to help you get your head around the basics of the sorts of things you need to do in a react app

## Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
