# Crypto Stock Compare

This repository was created to go along with my [React Crypo Stock Compare tutorial](https://sethreid.co.nz/react-crypto-indroduction-to-react/) to help you learn the basics of [React JS](https://reactjs.org/).

## Want to do the tutorial?

If you want to get started following along from with the tutorial then follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install NodeJS and Git**

If you don't already have them installed then you can find them here:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Note](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

**Step 2: Clone the repo**

You need to get the code to start with so run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sethreidnz/crypto-stock-compare
```

**Step 3: Install the NPM packages needed**

From the directory where you ran the `git clone` command run the following two commands to install the npm packages the project needs:

```bash
cd crypto-stock-compare
npm install 
```

**Step 4: Checkout the `start` branch**

The master branch (the default branch) contains the final code, so run the following to change into the `start` branch to get started:

```bash
git checkout start
```

**Step 5: Go back to the tutorial**

Now you are ready for [React Crypo Stock Compare the tutorial](https://sethreid.co.nz/react-crypto-indroduction-to-react/)!

## Overview

The tutorial is split into multiple parts each covering a simple but important part of building a web app with React. You can find the finished code for each step in a branch with the corresponding name in brackets.

- Part 1: Introduction (start)
- Part 2: Creating a basic component (creating-basic-component)
- Part 3: Splitting components up (splitting-components)
- Part 4: Using props to pass values and functions to sub-components (using-props)
- Part 5: Using state to manage fetching data from an API (using-state-for-api-requests)
- Part 6: Creating a new pages with React Router (react-router)

The intention of this repository and tutorial is to act as a guide to help you get your head around the basics of the sorts of things you need to do in a react app

## Getting start

### `npm install`

First you will need to install the npm packages. From the root directory of the project run:

```bash
npm install
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
